			I will always be there for you.<br>
			You will never be alone.<br>
			I will be that candle in the window,<br>
			So you can always find your way back home.<br><br>

			I will be the sun in the sky<br>
			To brighten up your day,<br>
			I will be the moon shining above,<br>
			So in the dark you can find your way.<br><br>

			I will be the blanket when you're cold.<br>
			You will feel my warmth around you,<br>
			I will be the shoulder for you to cry on<br>
			When you're upset or feeling blue.<br><br>

			I will be the listening ears<br>
			When you need someone to talk to.<br>
			I will be the advice that you need<br>
			When you don't know what to do.<br>
